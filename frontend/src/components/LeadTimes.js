      There are now almost no manufacturing facilities left in the Euro-zone who build product from imported neoprene sheeting. It has become more cost effective for all businesses to have their goods manufactured in Asia where machine skills and technology have improved dramatically.

Supplies from Asia are usually subject to longer lead times however, because of a 20+ year relationship with our factories, we receive a preferential service to speed up supply times in comparison to our competitors.

In addition, our freight partners (also trading with us for over 20 years) treat us to the very best available rates for both air and sea transportation allowing us to pass on a considerable saving.

Generally, we require a minimum of 4 weeks to produce your order should you require a quick solution. However, occasionally we can improve on this. Longer lead times result in lower prices if time is not critical and we are able to bring your order in by sea.
