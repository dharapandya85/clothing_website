      <p>
      We have extensive neoprene print expertise, an area that often leads to problems when using factories that do not offer the correct technology for printing. Our products are printed with specially formulated inks either by silk screen or sublimation process. All artwork should be supplied to us in digital file format. You will not need to send separations.

Print areas differ in size according to product. You will be advised of what the maximum print area is prior to final artwork.

Artwork is acceptable in PC format from Abobe Illustrator CS4, Adobe Photoshop CS4, CorelDraw X4 and Freehand. Vector files are preferred but we can also promise great results with high resolution JPEG or PSD files for sublimation printing.

We accept files by E-mail (max file size = 10mb), however we strongly recommend that artwork be sent on disk together with a colour laser proof in the post to Mark SG Enterprises Ltd. Click here to contact us.

We will always generate full PDF visuals for your approval prior to your financial commitment for all orders.
