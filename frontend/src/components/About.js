      <h2>About Neopremia</h2>
      <p>
      'Neopremia' is a brand division of Mark SG Enterprises Ltd. We are specialist manufacturers of bespoke products made from neoprene synthetic rubber materials. Neopremia is not a promotional merchandise agent; we are your direct source for design and manufacture in neoprene material.

We've been active in the neoprene rubber business for over 25 years, having originally worked in wetsuit design, development and production.

We offer our trade customers a significant market advantage as a direct result of our expertise in materials and assembly together with our supply-chain structure which has been in place for over 20 years.

We offer quick lead times, competitive pricing and excellent support services for sourcing companies across the globe. We manage orders into the UK, Europe and for an increasing number of US customers.

Sourcing your products directly from Asia can be a risky business. Through Neopremia, you can rest assured that our history, our factory investments and partnerships offer you complete assurance in quality control, delivery schedules and print finishing.

Product design and development is a principal part of our business offer - a thorough knowledge of capabilities and limitations in both materials and construction, Neopremia can manufacture almost anything in neoprene rubber material. Click a subsection on the left for some inspiration.
